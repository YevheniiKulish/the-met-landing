This is a landing page of the MET. There're header with menu, navigation and main title; main block with some sections presenting opening hours, exhibitions with small descriptions. The page also has contacts and addresses of museums and form to send small messages. There's a picture as footer of the landing page.

I used such technologies as HTML, CSS, Sass, BEM to create this landing page.
